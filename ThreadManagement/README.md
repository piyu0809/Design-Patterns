"I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will receive a grade of F for the course for any additional offense.”

Justification for choosing Vector DataStructure for Result Data Structure.
Vector is thread safe data structure that is why i have used Vector as Data Structure for results. 
If you use ArrayList then you will have to use synchronized keyword to make it thread safe.
